Process this file Convert the given Infix expressions to postfix expression using standard algorithm.  A – B + C $ D $ E - F * G / H                    and  x ^ y / ( 5 * z ) + 2  and  a + b * c + d  .                Show your Coding skills and Dont use any built-in function for handling character arrayRead the below algorithm         Steps to Convert Postfix to Infix :Read the symbol from the input .based on the input symbol go to step 2 or 3.If symbol is operand then push it into stack.If symbol is operator then pop top 2 values from the stack.this 2 popped value is our operand .create a new string and put the operator between this operand in string.push this string into stack.At the end only one value remain in stack which is our infix expression.Input the the expression to convert it into Infix form ((a+b)*c)  and (a+((b*c)/(d-e))) . Wait you have to do one more task to complete this assignmentyou have to evaluate on more statement to prove your  skills on basic stack working. Show the result if the given string after evaluation -14 . Oh again Invalid Expression! 

 Did you miss assignment 1?. Now, tell me the about the number of galxies in the picture. ):Total galxies in picture are  . Don't forget to save the genrated images in output folder.
This is simply a test of your stack management abilities. So, I hope you pass this test as well, so keep going. So now I'm sick of this stuff.  That, I believe, is sufficient.
